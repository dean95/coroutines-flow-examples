## Use cases

* **Example 1** - Transform some value to the reactive world.
* **Example 2** - Transform the data.
* **Example 3** - Filter certain items out.
* **Example 4** - Implement a toggle mechanism with initial value.
* **Example 5** - Sum up the latest values of the two Flows whenever one of the Flows emits a new value.
* **Example 6** - Execute two operations in parallel, wait for each other and process the combined data.
* **Example 7** - When the source emits the same value multiple times, only allow the first value to travel downstream.
* **Example 8** - Delay the source by some fixed time.
